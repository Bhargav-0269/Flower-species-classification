Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of flower images from various species. You can download the dataset from Kaggle or any other relevant source. Make sure to organize your dataset into the following directory structure:

Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following layers:

Convolutional layers
Max pooling layers
Fully connected layers
Dropout layers for regularization
You can find the detailed architecture in the model.py file.

Results
After training the model for 50 epochs, we achieved the following results:

Accuracy: 92%
Precision: 90%
Recall: 91%
F1 Score: 90%
The model performs well in classifying different flower species. Below is a confusion matrix for the test dataset:
